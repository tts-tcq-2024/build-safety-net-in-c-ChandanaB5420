Test Case ID.,Test Case Name,Test Case Description,Input,Expected Output,,,
TC_01,test_empty_string_returns_code_padded_with_four_zeros,"An empty string should produce a Soundex code consisting of four zeros, as there are no characters to encode.","""""","""0000""",,,
TC_02,test_single_letter_returns_letter_with_zeros,"A single letter should be returned as-is followed by three zeros, representing the absence of other significant consonants.","""A""","""A000""",,,
TC_03,test_typical_name_returns_expected_code,"The name ""Raghav"" is encoded by Soundex rules, resulting in ""R210"", where the consonants are converted to their respective codes.","""Raghav""","""R210""",,,
TC_04,test_case_insensitivity_returns_same_code,"Soundex is case-insensitive, so both ""Avinash"" and ""avinash"" should produce the same code ""A535"".","""Avinash"", ""avinash""","""A535""",,,
TC_05,test_short_name_returns_letter_with_truncated_code,"For short names, the Soundex code is formed by the first letter followed by numbers representing the consonants. Here, ""Avi"" becomes ""A100"".","""Avi""","""A100""",,,
TC_06,test_special_characters_ignored_in_code,"Special characters are ignored in Soundex encoding. Therefore, ""Ravi@#$"" simplifies to ""Ravi"", which is encoded as ""R100"".","""Ravi@#$""","""R100""",,,
TC_07,test_spaces_in_name_ignored_in_code,"Spaces are ignored in Soundex. The name ""Arvind Rao"" is treated as ""ArvindRao"", which results in the code ""A615"".","""Arvind Rao""","""A615""",,,
TC_08,test_special_characters_and_digits_ignored_in_code,"Special characters and digits are ignored. ""Manoj@123"" simplifies to ""Manoj"", which is encoded as ""M520"".","""Manoj@123""","""M520""",,,
TC_09,test_numbers_in_name_processed_as_letters,"Numbers are ignored in Soundex encoding. Thus, ""avina2"" is treated as ""avina"", which results in the Soundex code ""A150"".","""avina2""","""A150""",,,
TC_10,test_repeated_consonants_compressed_in_code,"Repeated consonants are reduced to a single code. ""Shashank"" becomes ""S252"", with repeated consonants like ""sh"" and ""s"" counted once.","""Shashank""","""S252""",,,
TC_11,test_hyphens_in_name_ignored_in_code,"Hyphens are ignored. ""Hari-Prasad"" is treated as ""HariPrasad"", resulting in the Soundex code ""H616"".","""Hari-Prasad""","""H616""",,,
